To run it:
1. Get a Steamship API Key (Visit: https://steamship.com/account/api). If you do not
   already have a Steamship account, you will need to create one.
2. Copy this key to a Replit Secret named STEAMSHIP_API_KEY. Here's how to do it: https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables
3. Click the green `Run` button at the top of the window (or open a Shell and type `python3 api.py`).

More information about this template is provided in README.md.
